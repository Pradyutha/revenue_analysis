# revenue_analysis

This data analysis project showcases the use of the Kaggle API to extract data, followed by Python for data transformation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Finally, the cleaned and transformed data is loaded into SQL to perform in-depth data analysis.

Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the revenue generation of a mart during the years 2022 to 2023. Through various analytical methods, the project aims to uncover trends, insights, and patterns that drive business decisions.

Key Highlights
Data Extraction:

Utilized the Kaggle API to fetch the dataset directly into the workspace, ensuring smooth and automated data retrieval.
Data Transformation:

Leveraged Python libraries like pandas and NumPy to clean, preprocess, and structure the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed various analyses, including trend identification, seasonality effects, and revenue comparison across different parameters.
Visualized insights using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn for better interpretation.
Data Loading and Analysis:

Loaded the transformed data into SQL to execute advanced queries and perform in-depth revenue analysis.
Learning Outcomes
This project was instrumental in understanding:

The architecture and workflow of integrating ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
Strengthening the fundamentals of data analysis and understanding key revenue metrics.
Enhancing proficiency in Python for data preprocessing and visualization, as well as SQL for querying and analytical purposes.
